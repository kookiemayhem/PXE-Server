# PXE-Server
Simple pxe server that anybody can use. Tested and recommended on Ubuntu-Server 14.04.4.

With a fresh Install of the server edit the script to adjust to your network settings. Install by bash with user account, or run the *make.sh to simply make the .conf files for your server if you already have one (no changes are made with this script). There are many packages to choose from, these are simply my personal choice for recommendation. 

Packages Installed/Used:
  isc-dhcp-server
  xinetd
  tftpd-hpa
  syslinux          
  nfs-kernel-Server
