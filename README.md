# PXE-Server
Simple pxe server that anybody can use. Tested and recommended on Ubuntu-Server 14.04.4.

With a fresh Install of the server edit the script to adjust to your network settings. Install by bash with user account, or run the *make.sh to simply make the .conf files for your server if you already have one (no changes are made with this script).
